Notes:
Emission factors are per unit of heat content using higher heating values (HHV). If heat content is available from the fuel supplier, it is preferable to use that value. If not, default heat contents are provided.
All CO2 emission factors assume that 100 percent of the carbon content of the fuel is oxidized to CO2, as is recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The CH4 and N2O emission factors provided represent emissions in terms of fuel type and by end-use sector (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial, electricity generation).
Please see the Center for Corporate Climate Leadership's guidance document on Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources for guidance on how to include biomass fuels in an organization's greenhouse gas inventory.

**Notes**:
Total output emission factors can be used as default factors for estimating GHG emissions from electricity use when developing a carbon footprint or emissions inventory.
Annual non-baseload output emission factors should not be used when developing a carbon footprint or emissions inventory, but can be used to estimate GHG emissions reductions on the grid from changes in electricity use.
Grid gross loss % factors provide the Transmission & Distribution loss rates for electricity only, and should not be applied to scope 2 emissions for an end-user. They can assist in calculating one component of Scope 3 Category 3 Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities emissions, Activity C.
For technical information, reference the EPA's eGRID Technical Guide
https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-01/egrid2023_technical_guide.pdf
The factors represented in the table above represent combustion emissions only (tank-to-wheel) and do not represent upstream emissions or well-to-wheel emissions.

### eGRID Subregions (text version of the map)

**Important:** eGRID boundaries follow the physics of the electric grid, _not_ political borders, so individual counties (or even utilities) can sit in a neighbouring sub-region. The “state coverage” column below simply tells you which **entire states or large parts of states** fall inside each sub-region when you eyeball EPA’s map above. Think of it as a quick orientation guide, not a legal description.

| Code     | Sub-region name        | Rough state coverage                                                  |

## Table 7: Steam and Heat

|                | CO2 Factor (kg CO2 / mmBtu)                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Steam and Heat |                                              66.33 |

**Notes**:

Emission factors are per mmBtu of steam or heat purchased. These factors assume natural gas fuel is used to generate steam or heat at 80 percent thermal efficiency.  
The factors represented in the table above represent combustion emissions only (tank-to-wheel) and do not represent upstream emissions or well-to-wheel emissions.

# Scope 3 Emission Factors

Scope 3 emission factors provided below are aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions, version 1.0 (Scope 3 Calculation Guidance). Where applicable, the specific calculation method is referenced. Refer to the Scope 3 Calculation Guidance for more information: http://www.ghgprotocol.org/scope-3-technical-calculation-guidance

## Table 8: Scope 3 Category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution and Category 9: Downstream Transportation and Distribution

These factors are intended for use in the distance-based method defined in the Scope 3 Calculation Guidance. If fuel data are available, then the fuel-based method should be used, with factors from Tables 2 through 5.

| Vehicle Type                             | CO2 Factor (kg CO2 / unit) | Units          |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Medium- and Heavy-Duty Truck<sup>C</sup> | 0.186                      | short ton-mile |
| Rail                                     | 0.021                      | short ton-mile |
| Waterborne Craft                         | 0.077                      | short ton-mile |
| Aircraft                                 | 1.086                      | short ton-mile |

**Source**:

CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions data for on-road vehicles are from Table 2-13 of the EPA (2024) Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2022.
Vehicle-miles data for on-road vehicles are from Tables A-71 - A-73 of the EPA (2024) Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2022 (Annexes).
CO2e emissions data for non-road vehicles are based on Table A-93 of the EPA (2024) Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2022 (Annexes), which are distributed into CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions based on fuel/vehicle emission factors.
Freight ton-mile data are from Table 1-50 of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, National Transportation Statistics (2024): 2022 data.

**Notes**:

Vehicle-mile factors are appropriate to use when the entire vehicle is dedicated to transporting the reporting company's product. Ton-mile factors are appropriate when the vehicle is shared with products from other companies.
The factors represented in the table above represent combustion emissions only (tank-to-wheel) and do not represent upstream emissions or well-to-wheel emissions.
<sup>A</sup> Passenger cars are automobiles used primarily to transport 12 people or less for personal travel, and are less than 8,500 lbs in gross vehicle weight.
<sup>B</sup> Light-duty trucks are vehicles that primarily transport passengers such as sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and minivans. This category also includes vehicles used for transporting light-weight cargo which are equipped with special features such as four-wheel drive for off-road operation. The gross vehicle weight normally ranges around 8,500 pounds or less.
<sup>C</sup> Medium- and heavy-duty trucks are vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of more than around 8,500 pounds, such as single unit trucks, combination trucks, tractor-trailers, and box trucks used for freight transportation. In addition, this category includes some vehicles that are not typically used for freight movement such as service and utility trucks.

## Table 9: Scope 3 Category 5: Waste Generated in Operations and Category 12: End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products

These factors are intended for use in the waste-type-specific method or the average-data method defined in the Scope 3 Calculation Guidance for category 5 and category 12. Choose the appropriate material and disposal method from the table below. For the average-data method, use one of the mixed material types, such as mixed MSW.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (December 2023) Documentation for Greenhouse Gas Emission and Energy Factors used in the Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Factors from tables provided in the Management Practices Chapters and Background Chapters.

**Notes**:

These factors do not include avoided emissions impact from any of the disposal methods. This exclusion is an adjustment to the life-cycle factors in the WARM tool. Thus the waste factors presented above will not directly match the factors published in the WARM tool. All the factors presented above include transportation emissions, which are optional in the Scope 3 Calculation Guidance, with an assumed average distance traveled to the processing facility.
AR4 GWP values are used to convert all waste emission factors into CO2e.
Short ton = 2000 lbs.
<sup>A</sup> Recycling emissions do not include avoided emissions associated with process energy, transportation energy, process non-energy, or forest carbon storage. Recycling emissions include transport to recycling facility and sorting of recycled materials at material recovery facility.
<sup>B</sup> Landfilling emissions do not include avoided emissions associated with energy recovery or landfill carbon sequestration. Landfilling emissions include transport to landfill, equipment use at landfill, and landfill CH4 emissions from anaerobic decomposition of biogenic carbon compounds. Landfill CH4 is based on typical landfill gas collection practices, average landfill moisture conditions, and U.S.-average non-baseload electricity grid mix.
<sup>C</sup> Combustion emissions do not include avoided emissions associated with displaced electric utility generation or decreased energy requirements for production processes using recycled inputs. Combustion emissions include transport to waste-to-energy facility and combustion-related non-biogenic CO2 and N2O.
<sup>D</sup> Composting emissions do not include avoided emissions associated with fertilizer offset or soil carbon storage. Composting emissions include transport to compost facility, equipment use at compost facility, and CH4 and N2O emissions during composting.
<sup>E</sup> Anaerobically Digested (Dry and Wet Digestate with Curing) emissions do not include avoided emissions associated with displaced electric utility generation, soil carbon storage, or avoided fertilizer application. Anaerobically Digested (Dry and Wet Digestate with Curing) emissions include transport to the anaerobic digester facility, equipment use at the anaerobic digester facility, biogas leakage at the digester, emissions released during the curing and land application process, and fugitive emissions during the curing and after land application.

**Notes**:

The factors represented in the table above represent combustion emissions only (tank-to-wheel) and do not represent upstream emissions or well-to-wheel emissions.
<sup>A</sup> Passenger cars are automobiles used primarily to transport 12 people or less for personal travel, and are less than 8,500 lbs in gross vehicle weight.
<sup>B</sup> Light-duty trucks are vehicles that primarily transport passengers such as sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and minivans. This category also includes vehicles used for transporting light-weight cargo which are equipped with special features such as four-wheel drive for off-road operation. The gross vehicle weight normally ranges around 8,500 pounds or less.
<sup>C</sup> Intercity rail: Amtrak long-distance rail between major cities. Northeast Corridor extends from Boston to Washington D.C. Other Routes are all routes outside the Northeast Corridor.
<sup>D</sup> Commuter rail: rail service between a central city and adjacent suburbs (also called regional rail or suburban rail).  
<sup>E</sup> Transit rail: rail typically within an urban center, such as subways, elevated railways, metropolitan railways (metro), streetcars, trolley cars, and tramways."
