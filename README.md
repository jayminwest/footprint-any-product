# Setup

- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Talk to Steve about getting the project secrets
- Create a free [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) account
- Create a free [Neon](https://neon.tech/) account
  - Access the project Steve shared with you and create a dev branch for yourself
  - Set the `DB_DEV_CONNECTION` environment variable to the connection string for your dev branch

# Server

- Check that FastAPI works: `fastapi dev main.py`

# LangGraph

- `sandbox.ipynb` is a notebook with some basic LangGraph code. If you can run that, you're good to go LangGraph-wise.
